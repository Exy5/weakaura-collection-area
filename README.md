# Weakaura Archive (Mists of Pandaria Classic)
*Patch 5.5.0 Build (61767)*
*Updated on - 02.07.2025*

A full archive of all currently available weakauras from **Merfin**.

### General Weakauras
The **"Equipped Items"** weakaura might be a duplicate, as most of the class weakauras already provide that. So the weakaura is only for people, who don't actually use the class weakauras. (shame on you either way :D )

### Class Weakauras

**All class weakauras** are provided in __2 different resolutions__, so just use the resolution that fits your screen-size.


### Will the archive be kept up-to-date?
I'll try to refresh the raid weakauras as well as Raid-backend etc. up-to-date.
Class weakauras will **NOT** be updated every time there is an update, as most likely people will customize them anyways.

If you'd like to have me check, if a specific class weakaura is updated, hit me up.
